# Web Components Battle

This is a repository aimed to test two different frameworks to build a very simple design system with web components, with the objective to see which one I like most and is more fun to use.

_Obs.: All of them will be using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and TypeScript_

## Why those two frameworks ?

Those two frameworks were chosen because they are more lightweight, Svelte compiles to vanilla JS and Lit is designed to create web components. I didn't want any heavy engine to be used in a web component that cna be used in any framework.

## The frameworks

### Svelte

The documentation is available [here](https://svelte.dev/docs). Inside Storybook, the native svelte format will be used.

### Lit

The documentation is available [here](https://lit.dev/docs/)

## The tooling

To build the sample design system, [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) will be used.
